## Imageprocessing

Image Processing Toolkit: Python OpenCV Project

This project is a comprehensive image processing toolkit built using Python and OpenCV. It provides a range of powerful and easy-to-use functions for applying various image processing techniques to a single image. With this toolkit, you can effortlessly perform tasks like image cropping, image zooming, adjusting brightness, horizontal shifting, and image rotation, all within a single program.

Key Features:
Image rotation: Rotate an image by a specified angle, enabling you to correct tilted images or create interesting visual effects.
By leveraging the power of OpenCV, this project offers efficient and high-quality image processing capabilities. The intuitive Python interface allows you to easily apply multiple techniques to a single image, providing a flexible and customizable experience. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this toolkit enables you to explore and experiment with various image processing techniques to achieve the desired visual results.
Image cropping: Select a region of interest within an image and extract it as a new image. This allows you to focus on specific areas of interest and discard irrelevant parts.
Image zooming: Enlarge or shrink an image based on a desired zoom level. This feature helps you visualize fine details or resize images for specific requirements.
Brightness adjustment: Modify the brightness of an image to enhance or reduce its overall luminance. This is useful for correcting underexposed or overexposed images.
Horizontal shifting: Shift the image horizontally, either to the left or right, to reposition its content. This technique can be handy for aligning objects or creating panoramic views.
